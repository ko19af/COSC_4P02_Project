    <p>Museums are an essential part of allowing the people of the present a
     chance to revisit history and learn via a collection of culturally, historically, 
     scientifically or even just artistically significant artifiacts, providing a glimpse into history.
     However, with most museums having large amounts of these artifacts, it is difficult for visitors
     to intake all the information available or even navigate their way through the museum to visit
     all their desired pieces/exhibits of the institute </p>
     
     <p>This is the purpose of our system, to provide an easy to use interface that allows a museum
     to upload their map to our program and allow an individaual to view and interact with the map.</p
